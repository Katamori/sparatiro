# Welcome to Sparatiro!

An extremely small wiki engine built on minimalism.

The basic idea is to have HTML files as the wiki pages containing nothing more than the sparatiro.jsand a custom text

Under heavy development.

# How to use

__engine contains every underlying mechanics. Don't modify it if possible.

## Dependencies

The engine contains the following third-party scripts:

* [jQuery 3.3.1](https://jquery.com/) - compressed

* [MarkdownJS by Dominic "evilstreak" Baggott](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) - browser build

These are loaded on every article you visit.

## Simple pages

Create an HTML file, but instead of the regular tags, include only `__engine/sparatiro.js` with a `script` tag.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are defined in the title (that is, the filename) separated by `~`.

## Article index	

Since Sparatiro is backend-agnostic, the only way of implementing features involving search (e.g. wanted pages, content, what links here) is by maintaining a manual article index by yourself.	

The article index file is `__settings/index.json` and you can use it by simply listing them as in the example.	

For security and usability reasons, "unindexed" pages (HTML files with name not appearing in the index) won't be rendered by Sparatiro.

## Development

### Modules

As of 2018-10-11, Sparatiro Modules are JS files containing functions used quite anywhere.

# TO-DO

* article index implementation
    * interrupt init on unindexed articles
        * utilize Promise rejects for that
    * colorize 404 URLs
    * implement reserved names
        * index display
        * random
        * wanted pages
    * better 404

* A huge refactor on naming

* Try to make an universal header without extra framework

* Merging design from "beta" branch as an optional display method

* Abandon jQuery altogether
    * is that even possible?
